# Basic Endpoints

## Login

This endpoint provides an authorization token needed by the rest of the endpoints. The Postman request will store the token in the environment, you wonâ€™t need to add it manually.&#x20;

Use this endpoint to get your API access token by sending your email and password. If you don't have your email/password please contact [APPLY NOW](../../apply-for-the-api.md) for our API and in a few hours you will be able to get your login credentials.

## Check balance

It lets you check your plan's balance. There are some important properties in the response:

* plans.renewDate: Unix time when your plan will be renewed and your balance will reset
* balances: Each item has total and balance. After the plan is renewed the balance property will be set to total.

Every client in Tweet Binder has a **Plan** (subscription) with associated **Balances**. You can check your total balances info and how much have you consumed using this endpoint. Balances show the number of reports or profiles remaining in the current month.
