# Reports Endpoints

## Types of reports

There are two types of reports:

* [Historical search](historical-searches.md): with two sub-types of reports
  * 7 day search: **covers the last** 7 days.
  * Full Historical: covers any date since 2006 (when Twitter was born).
* [Live report](live-reports.md): collects the information in real time. Live reports do not contain engagement information.

## Get report state

This endpoint returns a search document (AKA report) from our platform.&#x20;

For example, if you just created a report and ran this endpoint you will get this:

```json
{
    "_id": "f952405b-06eb-4a91-bfbc-c2228ac46d06",
    "version": 2,
    "createdAt": 1699436448,
    "updatedAt": 1699436448,
    "generatedTimes": 0,
    "createdFrom": "search/twitter/7-day",
    "type": "7-day",
    "source": "twitter",
    "status": "waiting",
    "userId": "ef68cbf9-6107-4f28-af0b-0b8681be7033",
    "query": {
        "or": [
            "Osasuna",
            "#Osasuna"
        ],
        "must": [
            "#Football"
        ],
        "nor": [
            "@RealMadrid"
        ],
        "lang": "en",
        "isRetweet": "included"
    },
    "settings": {
        "stream": {
            "or": [
                "Osasuna",
                "#Osasuna"
            ],
            "must": [
                "#Football"
            ],
            "nor": [
                "@RealMadrid"
            ],
            "lang": "en",
            "isRetweet": "included"
        },
        "name": "#Football (Osasuna OR #Osasuna) -(@RealMadrid) lang:en"
    },
    "affiliate": {
        "id": "9c4d6d6b-d389-40e9-bd90-a79bf1837b37",
        "createdAt": 1604491722,
        "expirationDate": null
    },
    "feedId": "7adf4d5f-ac04-4d58-9b77-58c32bd37ec7"
}
```

Notice the status field says "waiting", it means that the report is still being generated. This field can have several values:

* waiting : the search hasnâ€™t finished yet
* generated: the search has finished and stats have been generated
* outdated: some new publications are pending for processing, this will only happen with streams (live reports).

Once it is generated, it looks like this:

```json
{
    "_id": "f952405b-06eb-4a91-bfbc-c2228ac46d06",
    "version": 2,
    "createdAt": 1699436448,
    "updatedAt": 1699436461,
    "generatedTimes": 1,
    "createdFrom": "search/twitter/7-day",
    "type": "7-day",
    "source": "twitter",
    "status": "generated",
    "userId": "ef68cbf9-6107-4f28-af0b-0b8681be7033",
    "query": {
        "or": [
            "Osasuna",
            "#Osasuna"
        ],
        "must": [
            "#Football"
        ],
        "nor": [
            "@RealMadrid"
        ],
        "lang": "en",
        "isRetweet": "included"
    },
    "settings": {
        "stream": {
            "or": [
                "Osasuna",
                "#Osasuna"
            ],
            "must": [
                "#Football"
            ],
            "nor": [
                "@RealMadrid"
            ],
            "lang": "en",
            "isRetweet": "included"
        },
        "name": "#Football (Osasuna OR #Osasuna) -(@RealMadrid) lang:en"
    },
    "affiliate": {
        "id": "9c4d6d6b-d389-40e9-bd90-a79bf1837b37",
        "createdAt": 1604491722,
        "expirationDate": null
    },
    "feedId": "7adf4d5f-ac04-4d58-9b77-58c32bd37ec7",
    "economicValue": 1816.1599999999999,
    "generatedAt": 1699436459,
    "total": 91,
    "excelGeneratedAt": 1699436461
}
```
