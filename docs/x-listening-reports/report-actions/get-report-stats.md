# Get report stats

**Endpoint:** {{statsRoute}}/:reportCode/stats.json

**What it does:** This endpoint is used to get the stats of a report. The report must be **generated** in oder to get the stats.

**NOTE:** The :reportCode is not the :reportId 

Example: given this :reportId df688940-2bfd-4d15-bf55-fb3eebcd6c6d its :reportCode will be df688940 (the first chain of the :reportId)

## Stats - Structure

The structure of a Tweet Binder stats JSON is the following:

- Stats
    - General stats
    - Sentiment stats
    - Contributor rankings
    - Media rankings
    - Influence rankings
- Meta information

This is the main part of the JSON, its five sections show all the stats related to the analyzed hashtag. 

### General stats

In this section the client will receive the main stats of the hashtag or keyword he needs to analyze. It is shown this way in the JSON file:

We will explain one by one these stats:

1. **since.** Start of the report, this is the date of the first (oldest) tweet in the report. The client will be able to set a starting date, that will be the date Tweet Binder will start looking tweets from, the first tweet date may coincide or not. This value is expressed in milliseconds.
2. **until.** End of the report, this is the date of the last (newest) tweet in the report. The client will be able to set an ending date which will indicate the API when to stop collecting tweets. This value is expressed in milliseconds. 
3. **total.** Total number of tweets analyzed in the report. This will include original tweets and retweets. All those tweets are processed in the API to create the rest of the stats.
4. **images.** Total number of tweets with images, vídeos or GIF in the report. This metric shows how many tweets include media, they can also contain a link or not.
5. **links.** Total number of tweets containing a link. This link can point to a website outside Twitter or to another tweet.
6. **linksAndImages.** Total number of tweets containing media and a link. 
7. **impact.** Total number of **potential** impacts (impressions) generated by the hashtag. Impacts are calculated by multiplying the tweets of each user in the report by its followers and adding up the results. Example:
    
    User 1: 10 tweets and 100 followers = 1000 potential impacts (impressions)
    
    User 2: 5 tweets and 500 followers = 2500 potential impacts (impressions)
    
    User 3: 1 tweet and 10000 followers = 10000 potential impacts (impressions)
    
    TOTAL impacts = 1000 + 2500 + 10000 = 13500 potential impacts (impressions) 
    
8. **reach.** Total number of users reached by the hashtag. Reach will always be less or equal than “impact”. The way Tweet Binder calculates this number is just by adding up the number of followers of each user in the report, the number of tweets here is not relevant. Using the same example than “impact”:
    
    User 1: 100 followers 
    
    User 2: 500 followers
    
    User 3: 10000 followers
    
    TOTAL “reach” = 100 + 500 + 10000 = 10600 potential users reached (reach) 
    
9. **contributorsValue.** Total economic value of the users who participated in the report. This unique metric by Tweet Binder shows how much the users of the report are worth translated to Twitter advertising investment. This metric, expressed by default in USD, is made combining other metrics of the user which are:
    1. Number of followers
    2. Number of following
    3. Ratio followers/following
    4. Number of lists the user is in
    5. If the account is verified or not
    6. Average Twitter impressions per tweet (given by Twitter, specialized blogs and experts)
    7. Economic market value of an impact on Twitter (based on pay-per-tweet online platforms and CPMs by Twitter Ads)
10. **economicValue.** Total economic value of the hashtag the user analyzed. It is calculated using the “contributorsValue” and multiplying it by the type of tweets sent. Each type of tweet has an unique value.
11. **clears.** Total number of text tweets analyzed in the report. Tweets containing just text.
12. **replies.** Total number of replies analyzed in the report. 
13. **retweets.** Total number of retweets analyzed in the report.
14. **receivedRetweets.** Total number of retweets received by the tweets in the report. This number can be different from “retweets” because it contains ALL the retweets received which can come from private accounts or just be outside the date range of the report. That’s why this number will always be equal or higher than “retweets”.
15. **favorites.** Total number of likes received by the tweets in the report.
16. **Impressions.** Number of actual impressions generated by the tweets of the report. This can be higher or lower than the potential impressions, but it is usually lower.
17. **Quotes.** Number of quotes generated by the tweets of the report.
18. **totalReplies.** Number of replies generated by the tweets of the report.
19. **Bookmarks.** Number of bookmars generated by the tweets of the report.
20. **contributors.** Total number of users who sent a tweet or a retweet using the hashtag of the report.
21. **originalContributors.** Total number of users who sent at least one original tweet. Original tweets are those which are not retweets.
22. **originals.** Total number of original tweets analyzed in the report. Original tweets are those which are no retweets.
23. **tweetValueMean.** Average value, expressed by default in USD, of each tweet of the report. This metric can also be used as a way of checking the influence of the users in the report.
24. **influence.** Average number of followers per user in the report. This metric is calculated by dividing “reach” by the number of “contributors”.
25. **engagement.** Average number of tweets sent per contributor. This metric is calculated by dividing “total” by contributors.
26. **contributorValueMean.** Average value of each contributor, expressed by default in USD. This metric is calculated by dividing “contributorsValue” by “contributors”.

### Sentiment stats

Hashtag’s sentiment is calculated having several variables in consideration within each tweet and after that each tweet is given a value:

- Positive
- Negative
- Neutral
- Undefined

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/1e73907f-1eac-4616-bba4-66825c4dcff7/Untitled.png)

Each value has its one metrics under an unique id “_positive” for example; the explanation for each metric is the same than in “general stats”. These metrics are:

1. total
2. images
3. links
4. linksAndImages
5. impact
6. reach
7. contributorsValue
8. economicValue
9. clears
10. replies
11. retweets
12. originalContributors
13. contributors
14. influence
15. engagement
16. originals
17. tweetValueMean
18. contributorValueMean

There is another metric for sentiment that is applied to the whole report:

1. score: the score shows how positive or negative is the hashtag. It shows a value between 0 and 100 where 0 is “very negative” and 100 is “very positive”.

### Contributor rankings

        2. 1 = XS from 40 to 80 characters
        3. 2 = S from 80 to 120 characters
        4. 3 = M from 120 to 160 characters
        5. 4 = L from 160 to 200 characters
        6. 5 = XL from 200 to 240 characters
        7. 6 = XXL more than 240 characters
        
        Each range will show the following fields:
        
        1. influence: type of influence from XXS to XXL
        2. tweets: number of tweets in that influence
        3. lower limit: these are standard values, the starting limits of the influence
        4. upper limit: these are standard values, the ending limits of the influence
        
        The average value shows the average length of a tweet in the report.
        
    8. **oldVsNewInfluence:** this is an old metric use to differentiate how many tweets were sent with less than 140 characters and how many were sent with more than 140 characters. So there will be just two intervals:
        1. 0 = Old tweets, with less than 140 characters
        2. 1 = New tweets, with more than 140 characters
        
        Each range will show the following fields:
        
        1. influence: type of influence “old” or “new”
        2. tweets: number of tweets in that influence
        3. lower limit: these are standard values, the starting limits of the influence
        4. upper limit: these are standard values, the ending limits of the influence
        
        The average value shows the average length of a tweet in the report.
