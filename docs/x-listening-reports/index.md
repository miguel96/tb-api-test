# X Listening Reports

With our API you can create reports that analyze X (Twitter) content. This content is basically post (tweets). In this section we must differentiate "counts" from "reports". A count will only give us the number of posts (tweets) of a query, however, the "report" offers all the complete statistics. Counts are very useful when we want to quickly see how many posts (tweets) a particular event has obtained, which is also why counts are much faster than reports.

There are several types of reports/counts:

- Historical reports: Analyze information from the past

- - 7-day count
  - Historical count
  - 7-day report
  - Historical report
 
- Live reports: They analyze information in real time from the moment they are activated
