# X Listening Reports

With our API you can create reports that analyze X (Twitter) content. This content is basically post (tweets). In this section we must differentiate "counts" from "reports". A count will only give us the number of posts (tweets) of a query, however, the "report" offers all the complete statistics. Counts are very useful when we want to quickly see how many posts (tweets) a particular event has obtained, which is also why counts are much faster than reports.

There are several types of reports/counts:

- Historical reports: Analyze information from the past

  - 7-day count
  - Historical count
  - 7-day report
  - Historical report
 
- Live reports: They analyze information in real time from the moment they are activated. There are no counts in live reports.

Live reports do not include engagement data (likes, reposts, impressions, etc.) because the posts are collected so quickly that there is no time for any engagement to enter. They can be updated later.

These are some parameters you can use
keyword	Standalone	Essential	"Matches a keyword within the body of a Tweet. This is a tokenized match, meaning that your keyword string will be matched against the tokenized text of the Tweet body. Tokenization splits words based on punctuation, symbols, and Unicode basic plane separator characters.

For example, a Tweet with the text ‚ÄúI like coca-cola‚Äù would be split into the following tokens: I, like, coca, cola. These tokens would then be compared to the keyword string used in your query. To match strings containing punctuation (for example coca-cola), symbol, or separator characters, you must wrap your keyword in double-quotes.

Example: pepsi OR cola OR ""coca cola"""
emoji	Standalone	Essential	"Matches an emoji within the body of a Tweet. Similar to a keyword, emojis are a tokenized match, meaning that your emoji will be matched against the tokenized text of the Tweet body.

Note that if an emoji has a variant, you must wrap it in double quotes to add to a query.

Example: (üòÉ OR üò°) üò¨"
"exact phrase match"	Standalone	Essential	"Matches the exact phrase within the body of a Tweet.

Example: (""Twitter API"" OR #v2) -""recent search"""
#	Standalone	Essential	"Matches any Tweet containing a recognized hashtag, if the hashtag is a recognized entity in a Tweet.

This operator performs an exact match, NOT a tokenized match, meaning the rule #thanku will match posts with the exact hashtag #thanku, but not those with the hashtag #thankunext.

Example: #thankunext #fanart OR @arianagrande"
@tweetbinder 	Standalone	Essential	"Matches any Tweet that mentions the given username, if the username is a recognized entity (including the @ character).

Example: (@twitterdev OR @twitterapi) -@twitter"
$	Standalone	Elevated	"Matches any Tweet that contains the specified ‚Äòcashtag‚Äô (where the leading character of the token is the ‚Äò$‚Äô character).

Note that the cashtag operator relies on Twitter‚Äôs ‚Äòsymbols‚Äô entity extraction to match cashtags, rather than trying to extract the cashtag from the body itself.

Example: $twtr OR @twitterdev -$fb"
from:	Standalone	Essential	"Matches any Tweet from a specific user.
The value can be either the username (excluding the @ character) or the user‚Äôs numeric user ID.

You can only pass a single username/ID per from: operator.

Example: from:twitterdev OR from:twitterapi -from:twitter"
to:	Standalone	Essential	"Matches any Tweet that is in reply to a particular user.
The value can be either the username (excluding the @ character) or the user‚Äôs numeric user ID.

You can only pass a single username/ID per to: operator.

Example: to:twitterdev OR to:twitterapi -to:twitter"
url:	Standalone	Essential	"Performs a tokenized match on any validly-formatted URL of a Tweet.

This operator can matches on the contents of both the url or expanded_url fields. For example, a Tweet containing ""You should check out Twitter Developer Labs: https://t.co/c0A36SWil4"" (with the short URL redirecting to https://developer.twitter.com) will match both the following rules:

from:TwitterDev url:""https://developer.twitter.com""
(because it will match the contents of entities.urls.expanded_url)

from:TwitterDev url:""https://t.co""
(because it will match the contents of entities.urls.url)

Tokens and phrases containing punctuation or special characters should be double-quoted (for example, url:""/developer""). Similarly, to match on a specific protocol, enclose in double-quotes (for example, url:""https://developer.twitter.com"")."
list:	Standalone	Elevated	"NEW Matches Tweets posted by users who are members of a specified list. 
For example, if @twitterdev and @twitterapi were members of List 123, and you included list:123 in your query, your response will only contain Tweets that have been published by those accounts. You can find List IDs by using the List lookup endpoint.
Please note that you can only use a single list: operator per query, and you can only specify a single List per list: operator.
Example: list:123"
has:media	Conjunction required	Essential	"Available alias: has:media_link

lang:	Conjunction required	Essential	"Matches Tweets that have been classified by Twitter as being of a particular language (if, and only if, the Tweet has been classified). It is important to note that each Tweet is currently only classified as being of one language, so AND‚Äôing together multiple languages will yield no results.

You can only pass a single BCP 47 language identifier per lang: operator.

Note: if no language classification can be made the provided result is ‚Äòund‚Äô (for undefined).

Example: recommend #paris lang:en
