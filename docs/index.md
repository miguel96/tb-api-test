## What can you use the Tweet Binder API for?

The use cases are multiple and we could summarize them in:

- Get analytics of a hashtag or term historically or in real time
- Obtain real-time data on cryptocurrencies, cashtags or company tickers
- Show X Twitter data in a control panel or on a live web page
- Integrate X Twitter analytics into private dashboards to combine them with other statistics
- Track the performance of X (Twitter) users: evolution of followers, mentions, etc.
- Know the impact of events or television audiences
- Obtain rankings of users related to certain topics of interest
- Analyze X (Twitter) user graphs
- Export information to integrate it with Audiense tools
- Show live posts (tweets) on events or TV shows

All of the above can be obtained with our API. You will need credentials to log in and a balance of posts (tweets) to create your own reports and with that you will be able to operate.

It happens in many cases that our clients have a different, special or very specific use case that is not included in our API. We can develop for you the output you want as we have done numerous times, [just talk to us](https://www.tweetbinder.com/api/), so far we have created:

- A new metric
- A new set of metrics
- A combination of metrics
- A new data format
- A specific dashboard

If what you need is raw content from X (Twitter) we recommend that you go directly to the official Twitter API page.
